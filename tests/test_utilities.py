"""
Utilities for reading and transforming XML and dictionary samples.

Note that request samples should not include the "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='cp1047'?>"
header since the test cases use an override to dump request XML as utf-8, which causes the
xml generated to have no header.

Also note that XML and json samples should contain indintation for readability.
The 'minify_xml' function handles the process of removing leading/trailing
white space and new lines for XML files. JSON files are read into a dictionary
using the 'json' library.
